I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Architecture (Urban climate) at Zhejiang University, co-supervised at ETH Zürich, and expected to graduate in October 2025.

My research interests center on urban climatology, remote sensing, and machine learning, with a strong emphasis on:

·Deep learning–based land cover classification and analysis

·Urban thermal comfort modeling by integrating the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and SOLWEIG

·Evaluation of urban heat mitigation measures through advanced modeling techniques
