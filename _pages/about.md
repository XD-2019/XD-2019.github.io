I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Architecture (Urban climate) at Zhejiang University, co-supervised at ETH Zürich, and expected to graduate in October 2025.
I have in-depth research experience and strong skills in building environment and urban climate studies spanning multiple spatial scales, from micro-scale to mesoscale. My expertise includes:
* Meso-scale urban climate modeling using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with urban canopy models
* Deep learning–based high-resolution (~1 m) urban land cover classification and analysis
* Machine learning–based urban air temperature prediction integrating observational datasets
* Urban micro-scale thermal comfort modeling (2-10m) by combining WRF simulations with the SOLWEIG model

Education
======
* Direct Ph.D in Architecture (Urban climate), Zhejiang University (Co-supervised at ETH, Zurich), 2019-2025 (expected)
* B.S. in Mechanical engineering, Nanjing University of Science and technology, 2013-2017

Work experience
======
* 2017-2019: Wind power resource engineer, Zhejiang Windey Co., Ltd. (One of the top Wind turbine manufacturer in China)
* 2019-2021: Research Assistant, Honhkong University-Zhejiang Institute of Research and Innovation
  
Skills
======
* Machine learning: CNN-based satellite image recognation, land cover classification, Physics-informed machine learning methods, Explainable machine learning techniques...
